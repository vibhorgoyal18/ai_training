# In a school, there are total 20 students numbered from 1 to 20. You’re given three lists named ‘C’, ‘F’, and ‘H’, representing students who play cricket, football, and hockey, respectively. Based on this information, find out and print the following:
# Students who play all the three sports
# Students who play both cricket and football but don’t play hockey
# Students who play exactly two of the sports
# Students who don’t play any of the three sports
# Format:
# Input:
# 3 lists containing numbers (ranging from 1 to 20) representing students who play cricket, football and hockey respectively.
# Output:
# 4 different lists containing the students according to the constraints provided in the questions.
#
# Note: Make sure you sort the final lists (in an ascending order) that you get before printing them; otherwise your answer might not match the test-cases.
#
# Examples:
# Input 1:
# [2, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
# [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 16]
# [1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15]
# Output 1:
# [2, 5, 9, 13]
# [16]
# [12, 15, 16]
# [3, 8, 14, 20]
#
# Explanation:
# 1.Given the three sets, you can see that the students numbered '2', '5', '9', and '13' play all the three sports.
# 2. The student numbered '16' plays cricket and football but doesn't play hockey.
# 3. The student numbered '12' and '15' plays cricket and hockey and the student numbered '16' plays cricket and football.
# There are no students who play only football and hockey. Hence, the students who play exactly two sports are 12, 15, and 16.
# 4. As you can see, the students who play none of the sports are 3, 8, 14, and 20.

input_list = ast.literal_eval(input_str)
C = input_list[0]
F = input_list[1]
H = input_list[2]

# Convert the given lists to sets as it is easier to perform the given operations
# on sets
C = set(input_list[0])
F = set(input_list[1])
H = set(input_list[2])

# Perform an '&' operation between the three sets to find out the students who play
# all the three sports. Finally, convert it into a list, apply the sorted() function
# and print the resultant list.
print(sorted(list(C & F & H)))

# The following opeartion gives the students who play only Cricket and Football.
# Note that only (C & F) also contains the students who play all the three sports
# and hence, we need to subtract (C & F & H) from it.
print(sorted(list((C & F) - (C & F & H))))

# The students who play exactly three sports can be given by the following expression
# (C & F) gives the students who play cricket and football, (F & H) gives the students
# who play football and hockey, and (F & H) gives the students who play cricket and
# hockey. Performing an 'OR' operation ('|') between the three will give the students
# who play a minimum of two sports and finally subracting (C & F & H) will give the
# list of students who play exactly two sports.
print(sorted(list(((C & F) | (F & H) | (C & H)) - (C & F & H))))

# As the students are numbered from 1 to 20, the whole set of students can be defined
# by creating a set containing all the numbers from 1 to 20, using range. Finally,
# you can subract (C | F | H), from the created set to get all the students who don't
# play even a single sport.
print(sorted(list(set(range(1,21)) - (C | F | H))))
